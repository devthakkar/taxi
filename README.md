# Predicting Manhattan Taxi Duration

As part of an upper division Data class project, we used a database of historical Manhattan taxi data to create a regression model to predict the duration of a taxi ride given multiple parameters including pickup/dropoff location and time of day. 

Originally a jupyter notebook project.
